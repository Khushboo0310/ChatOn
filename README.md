# ChatOn

Simple yet very interactive chat application based on Node.js socket.io programming paradigm.

Simply run the node server at http://localhost:5000/

Can open multiple connections to the server which creates new socket for each new user with UUID(4).
New connections get updated on every clients session. Users will notify when a particular user is typing a message.
Each user will have a RandomColor for their particular session.

Will be adding many more features to it like sending images, GIFs and option to pin any message to the top of the conversation and many more...

Thanks for reading the description.
